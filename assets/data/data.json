One side, however, is narrower which allows the dulcimer to be played in a \"guitar position\" in addition to the normal \"lap position\". Thus, the fingering is inverted from normal style. It is kind of a missing link between the traditional mountain dulcimer and our \"stick style\" Wildwood Dulcimer. The inverted fingerings are a little easier for guitar players but it still produces the rich, full sound of a mountain dulcimer. When you want to play in a traditional style, lay it flat and play it like any other mountain dulcimer. Many tunings will work, but we recommend the traditional DAD to makes it easy to pick up and play. The solid spruce soundboard features three \"F-hole\" openings. The back, sides, and fretboard, are rosewood. The fretboard has arches underneath allowing free space between the soundboard and the fretboard. The carved scroll peghead has geared 4:1 banjo style tuners. A pick and noter are included. Special Note: The strings put on the instruments in our workshop, while playable, are put through some rigorous testing. They should probably be replaced for improved playability, sound quality, and better tuning shortly after you receive the instrument. We recommend using Roosebeck branded strings.",

The Helicore Octave Violin Set is designed to be played one octave below traditional violin tuning for a new world of tonal and stylistic possibilities. It utilizes the same core technologies as the original Helicore violin set. This set is considerably thicker than traditional violin strings. As a result, they require extra care to ensure they are properly installed on your violin. Please follow these guidelines for installation: Check that the grooves in your bridge and nut have room to accommodate the diameter of the octave strings. Excessive pressure or pinching may prevent normal movement. For best results, thoroughly apply graphite (pencil lead) to grooves before installing each string. Helicore violin strings are crafted with a multi-stranded steel core, resulting in optimal playability while producing a clear, warm tone. The smaller string diameter provides quick bow response. Premium quality materials combined with skilled workmanship produces strings known for excellent pitch stability and longevity.  \"",

      "description": "This full set of Passione violin strings 4/4 from Pirastro are medium gauge, and offer a big and powerful sound. The sheep gut core of the Passione violin strings is manufactured, wound and polished in the traditional way - by hand. The core sound is full, round and warm and has a complex overtone spectrum causing brilliance and clarity and a great power of projection. Passione strings possess a fascinating diversity of sounds, which allows musicians to alter their tone as desired. These violin strings offer very easy response on all levels of the dynamic range. The accuracy of the contact point is easily manageable, and they boast a significantly reduced playing-in time: Passione strings are immediately playable, unlike some other gut strings. Altering the gauge by 1/4 PM changes the tension by 3%. For some time, a new trend evolved, especially amongst young classical violinists who search for a full and complex sound, to start experimenting with violin strings with a gut core. Pirastro has now picked up this trend and developed the Passione violin string line. E string: Ball end / Silvery Steel A string: Ball end / Aluminium Winding - Gut Core D string: Ball end / Silver Winding - Gut Core G string: Ball end / Silver Winding - Gut Core Special Features The length of coloured silk at the peg end of the Passione G-string is different than the length of the A- and D- strings. This has been designed intentionally and is part of the construction of the G-string. The special length of the G-string’s colour winding at the peg end prevents the string from breaking in the peg box. At the latest after two to three days the stretching process will be finalized. As a result the silk winding will no longer reach over the nut. We have made numerous tests with this special G on various violins all differing in size and the string has always fitted. On some violins it takes longer, with other violins the string even fits from the beginning. About Pirastro strings: Because of the quality of both their strings and rosin, Pirastro has become the byword for a sound which is both beautiful and dependable. As a result, a great number of string musicians play and recommend Pirastro strings. With their tonal flexibility and expressive power, Pirastro strings have inspired musicians to create their own unique sound by taking full advantage of their instruments best qualities. Each individual string in the Pirastro line has been meticulously crafted to provide musicians with an unsurpassed choice in tonal colours. Musicians can choose from the complete range of gut strings (e.g. Passione and Oliv) to synthetic strings (such as Evah Pirazzi and Tonica) or steel (e.g. Flexocor and Chromcor). Finally, Pirastro rosins are designed specifically for use with Pirastro strings and this combination is responsible, in no small part, for the excellent world-renowned Pirastro sound.",

      "description": "With standard E-E tuning this guitar just stayed in the dryer a bit too long. This guitar is built using a larger “Artist” or F-Style Mandola type body to increase the resonant air chamber providing more volume, better low-end response, and adds just the right amount of timber in its voicing. Compared to our previous manditar models, the newer F-6 and F-12 uses an extended 15” scale allowing for more hand room. Barre chords are even possible near the nut. The Zero Glide nut is very effective at maintaining tuning stability and allows for the lowest possible action alleviating the string tension which is common with short scale instruments. The fretboard is radiused for comfort and the ebony bridge contains a built-in pickup for easy plugged-in playing. Bottom line is this guitar is another voicing to add to your recording studio, band, solo gig, or just to jam with. If you’re looking to achieve a mandolin sound without learning to play the mandolin this does the trick (although, we think you should learn mandolin too)! With the shorter scale length, it lends itself to opening tuning so you can focus more on single or harmonic notes while strumming. Whether you’re looking to add color to songs that you have been playing for years or looking for new sounds, this will definitely spark your imagination. Comes with a soft case!",

If you're a Tele player and you think this is an interesting question, here's the answer: it's the DiMarzio DP421 Area Hot T Tele Bridge Pickup. Because it has the classic Tele 6-magnet configuration, it's not simply a PAF reduced to Tele size. The sound is more detailed and controlled. The plain strings both sing and sting, and the wound strings have a dynamic quality that's halfway between a humbucker and a P90. The Area Hot T Bridge uses Alnico 2 magnets like other Area models, and works well with either 250K or 500K controls. Recommended For: Standard Tele bridge position. Tech Talk: Like the Area T, the Area Hot T Bridge has outstanding dynamic range, and it responds instantly to changes in pick attack and volume. It's also very sensitive to string distance. The volume is high when the pickup is close to the strings, but can be reduced by backing the Area T Bridge away. String pull is not a problem with the same Alnico 2 magnets that are standard on the Area T. 250K is the recommended control value, but higher values like 500K all around or a 250K volume and the 1 Megohm EP1202 can add some twang to the basic tone.",

It is also easily washable! The sculptured shape of the all Mach One Shoulder Rests mold perfectly to your shoulder. The \"S\" shape fits comfortably on your shoulder and minimizes the size of the feet. These are molded from a single piece rubber and have a lifetime guarantee.

This kit includes all of the parts you need to build your own short-scale (30-inch) 2-string electric bass, tuned to G-D. This tuning and setup makes it easy for NON-bassists and NON-guitarists to get started playing bass along with their favorite cigar box guitar songs... we even include a how-to-play section in the assembly guide walking you through playing along with your first couple of songs!We named this the \"G-Bass\" kit for three reasons: it's a play on the classic \"P-Bass\" released by Fender in the 1950's; it's tuned to Open G; and it's designed and made by Gitty!Featuring a solid hard maple neck and box-through brace, and a genuine mahogany fretboard/fingerboard. The box is cut from 1/4\" and 1/8\" Arctic Birch plywood, which has superior tonal qualities. We include two chrome bass guitar tuners, a hardwood bridge, and a custom stainless steel tailpiece of (cut here in the C. B. Gitty workshop). The fully pre-wired pickup harness features a classic-style black covered bass pickup, volume pot and standard mono jack. Includes decorative nickel-plated box corners and chrome strap buttons.The kit includes an unfretted fretboard marked using the shorter 30-inch scale made popular by Fender's \"Mustang\" model back in the 60's. The shorter scale makes it easier to play a 2-string bass, since you don't have to move around quite as much. Overall assembled length of the instrument is 40 inches.This kit includes a full assembly guide packed with photos and detailed how-to information. You will need basic tools (drill, drill bits, clamps, sandpaper, files/rasps, etc) to assemble this kit. The body of the instrument is a laser-cut plywood box specially designed by Ben \"Gitty\" Baker for strength and sturdiness; this box comes in its natural \"blank slate\" wood state, so that you can stain, decorate and apply finishes as desired.",

Made of nickel-plated steel, Dean Markley HELIX HD electric guitar strings are light strings that will give your guitar a sound like no other. It took over a year and many trials for the Dean Markley team to find just the precise elliptical shape for the winding wire that make up the patent-pending, Hyper-Elliptical Winding process of the Helix HD guitar strings. This shape then had to be paired with the correct winding process that would produce these stupendous results-the maximum mass for the string's diameter that still maintained the string's vibrancy. The Hyper-Elliptical Winding process results in an increased number of wraps along the length of the electric guitar string. This increases the mass of your string, without changing its diameter or material. More mass makes a fuller tone; more windings give a smoother feel as well as a brighter, more resonant tone. This provides a smoothness and performance unrivaled by conventional strings. When you press and strum a normal wrap wire, your fingers experience resistance as they go down into each depression between the wraps. With the Dean Markley HELIX HD electric guitar strings you'll experience smoothness. These less coarse wrappings let your fingers glide more easily and smoothly along the surface of the wrap wire.",

This cleverly designed and ergonomically shaped padded cushion elevates the guitar to just the right playing height so that a footstool is unnecessary. This is a boon to thousands of players-especially those taller players who have had to hunch over the guitar to be able to use the conventional footrest. The Dynarette is available in two models-the GD-10 and the GD-20. The cushion rests on the players' right or left leg and a wide variety of positions may be obtained. The GD-20 raises the guitar approximately 5 1/2\" and the GD 10 raises it 3 1/2\". The Dynarette is made of dense, resilient foam with a zippered cover of soft and sturdy leatherette. Many satisfied guitarists have written that their previous physical problems resulting from using the traditional footstool have completely disappeared after just a few days' use of the Dynarette. Try the Dynarette Classical Guitar Cushion and see the difference!",

Evah Pirazzi Gold cello strings are extremely responsive and react quickly over the entire dynamic range; even with very gentle bow pressure. With their reduced playing-in time, the instrument achieves its full sound spectrum in no time. Each Evah Pirazzi Gold cello string has its own individual character and at the same time their interplay generates a wonderfully harmonious set. Beginning with a smooth and rich spectrum of sound colors, the A-string has a warm and silvery sound that will easily satisfy the expectations of soloists. Charm, brilliance, and lightness are the sound characteristics of the D-string. The seamless transition to the G-string adds a further nuance that can be heard. The sound becomes very grand and develops an impressive radiance, even straight after stringing. Vibrant and resonant the C-string was designed to provide the player with a focused direct sound that will inspire and at the same time bring this set to its powerful completion. The A and D strings have a high-tensile steel core and are wound with a precision chrome steel flat wire, while the G and C strings have a specially designed steel rope core with a top-quality tungsten winding. These strings are also very suitable for electric or electrically-amplified cellos.",

Other features include a sturdy 5-piece Maple/Rosewood SR5 neck, a Rosewood fretboard, and a B305 bridge. Cosmo Black hardware adds a hint of stealth. At the heart of the SR405EQM's electronics are two PowerSpan Dual Coil pickups. Their stainless pole pieces offer higher output, clarity, and fullness than any in the SR405’s class. Accessed by the 3-way “Power Tap” switch, these proprietary pickups offer a choice of three tonal personalities: A rich humbucker sound, a pure single-coil sound, or an enhanced single coil sound— fattened by lows from the humbucker pickups. Add the ability to dial in precise tone preferences via the Ibanez Custom 3-band EQ, and the SR405EQM is a musical chameleon.",

This core has greater elasticity than that of conventional strings, which means less inertia and a higher propensity to musical vibration. The sound is full and homogenous, balanced and voluminous. The string has been calibrated to satisfy the express wish of many artists for an equally effective arco and pizzicato. Particularly bassists with a low C extension will value this string's reliability. Spiro core is also much favored by jazz bassists because of its suitability for amplified pickup tone. Thomastik-Infeld has tackled notorious 'cello problems such as wolf notes and muting difficulties with Spiro core C and G strings in wound tungsten and silver wound. Spiro core's hi-tech core makes for effortless fingering, responsive bowing, stable tuning and a very long string life. With Spiro core the steel string's technical possibilities have been developed to their maximum.",

The Tricolore brand, used by many famous violin soloists, was one of the most well-known violin strings made in the 20th century. Now, after many decades of being unavailable, we are pleased to offer these strings again. This string was developed by Ray Neiner at the Perfection Musical String Co. Brunswick, IN, just south of Chicago. The machines we use at Gamut Music to make the strings were purchased from the Perfection company, and in addition to the machines, we also received the formulations that Perfection used to make their strings, including the Tricolore brand. We have in our archives a copy of the Perfection workshop book that specifies the gauge of gut used for the cores, the size of the wires, length of the strings, and colors of the thread used for the stockings at the top and bottom of the strings. In addition to this practical information, we also received instruction for the special curing treatment that the gut cores went through before being wound and the specific techniques used in winding the wire onto the gut core. These strings are accurate copies of the ones that filled American concert halls with sound in the 20th century.",

Today they have a different knowledge and new techniques at hand to design a nylon core string set. As a result they have newly constructed all of the Tonica® strings except for the E steel wound with aluminum string. These changes result in an overall improved string set. Sound Characteristics The Tonica® has now a livelier and more round sound, which is open and direct with less side noises. The projection and brilliance have been upgraded. This excess of brilliance, however, does not mean that the Tonica® has lost its warmth. The set harmony is better. The response is easier and faster. Playing pianissimo has considerately improved. All bow strokes are possible resulting in smooth crossings from one note to another. Easier right hand articulation and tone attack.",

Any less of a quality wood bow will not give you the right weight distribution or curve. We prefer it over the presto viola bows. Many times better than the LaSalle viola bows, of course. Perfect viola bow upgrade if you have purchased a kremona, Mendini or Cecilia outfit. High quality hand made carbon fiber composite viola bow. Nicely decorated copper mounted ebony frog.

It features a stainless steel loop-end E string, an aluminum wound synthetic core A string, a silver wound synthetic core D string, and a gold wound synthetic core G string. This full 4/4 violin string set is medium gauge. The sound of Evah Pirazzi Gold Violin strings is full-bodied from the very bottom to the top of the register. The design of the individual strings has been carefully matched to one another allowing for effortlessly smooth transitions from string to string giving the strings both a marked presence and clarity and outstanding pedal-like resonance. Two versions of the G string are available, one wound with gold and one with silver. This flexibility allows the performer to gauge which string will match his or her personal preference as well as that of the instrument. The gold wound G string gives a round and full tone, while that of the silver wound G string emphasizes brightness. The innovative material used in the E string offers excellent response and a large, noble, and smooth sound to the very top of the register. The E string is available with a ball or loop end.",

Its beautiful design and incredible frequency response make this instrument to be loved and used in symphony, jazz and contemporary music. Shadow's Nanoflex technology makes no compromise in preserving these features. It is built to reproduce the instrument vibrations authentically with every move of the bow in all positions. No need of instrument modification was a must in developing this absolutely noise and hum free violin pickup system. Nanoflex pickups do not only take the vibrations of the strings like common under saddle pickups. Nanoflex senses the vibrations of the strings AND the body of the instrument simultaneously. No other pickup technology gives you this high level of sound reproduction. Due to active amplification directly at the pickup and 100% shielding of the entire system, no sound will be lost and no hum created. This is why the best violin players in the world are using the Shadow SH 945 NFX violin Nanoflex pickup system. The pickup mounts easily under the bridge and senses the vibrations of the bridge and the body. Control unit with volume and tone potentiometer mounts on violin side with chin rest type assembly. The control unit has input for pickup and standard 1/4-Inch jack output, 3V cell battery (2032). Mounts easily and provides 1 year lifetime.",

      "description": "The Pegasus bridge was originally designed for extended range instruments. However, 6 string players immediately demanded we offer a version to call their own. It incorporates an alnico 5 bar magnet and custom winding specs. The goal was to deliver a warm, balanced, responsive, and lush tone for progressive metal. It's a harmonically rich pickup with a prominent midrange and a focused low end. The high resonant peak makes for a sparkly top end and an incredible \"bloom\" on chords in high-gain situations. The responsive and accurate pick attack ensures that you will cut through any live mix, and will have tight-tracking transients in a studio environment. Because the Pegasus is a moderate output pickup, it works as well for clean tones as it does for distorted tones. The Sentient neck delivers a balanced, versatile tone that fits right between the '59 model and the Jazz neck pickup. You'll get pristine cleans and fluid leads under high gain. The Sentient is a very articulate vintage output pickup with great dynamic response and a wide harmonic range. It works great for low tunings in all humbucker-equipped guitars.",

      ],
      "description": "The Pegasus bridge was originally designed for extended range instruments. However, 6 string players immediately demanded we offer a version to call their own. It incorporates an alnico 5 bar magnet and custom winding specs. The goal was to deliver a warm, balanced, responsive, and lush tone for progressive metal. It’s a harmonically rich pickup with a prominent midrange and a focused low end. The high resonant peak makes for a sparkly top end and an incredible “bloom” on chords in high-gain situations. The responsive and accurate pick attack ensures that you will cut through any live mix, and will have tight-tracking transients in a studio environment. Because the Pegasus is a moderate output pickup, it works as well for clean tones as it does for distorted tones. The Sentient neck delivers a balanced, versatile tone that fits right between the ’59 model and the Jazz neck pickup. You’ll get pristine cleans and fluid leads under high gain. The Sentient is a very articulate vintage output pickup with great dynamic response and a wide harmonic range. It works great for low tunings in all humbucker-equipped guitars. Hand built in our Santa Barbara, CA, factory, the Pegasus and Sentient both feature an alnico 5 bar magnet, nickel silver bottom plate, 4-conductor lead wire for multiple wiring options, and are vacuum wax potted for squeal-free performance.",

Made traditionally by hand, LIEBENZELLER rosin contains delicate bubbles which emphasize the special quality and spirited nature of the rosin. Using pure larch resin with the addition of different metals produces livelier, warmer and brighter sounds than other rosins. This will help produce enhanced tonal volume, greater modulation and carrying power, conveying the individual sound of the instrument without effort, and one-sided tones can be compensated. The bow develops an excellent and even response, with ambient noise minimized. Choosing the right rosin is critical as it is the rosin that creates the sound while playing. LIEBENZELLER rosin enhances a string instrument's sound as well as the player's creativity with as little effort as possible. We are proud to reintroduce LIEBENZELLER rosin to the united States after an extended period when it was unavailable here. LIEBENZELLER rosin is available with Gold, silver, copper or meteor Iron added for a range of unique sounds. Meteor Iron wonderfully clear, the tone is light, brilliant and sounds vigorous even if played softly. The player's intention can be heard more easily. Especially suitable for solos.

      "description": "Liebenzeller Rosin Liebenzeller metal rosin has been made in a small village in the German Black Forest for over 40 years. Made traditionally by hand, Liebenzeller rosin contains delicate bubbles which emphasize the special quality and spirited nature of the rosin. Using pure larch resin with the addition of different metals produces livelier, warmer and brighter sounds than other rosins. This will help produce enhanced tonal volume, greater modulation and carrying power, conveying the individual sound of the instrument without effort, and one-sided tones can be compensated. The bow develops an excellent and even response, with ambient noise minimized. Choosing the right rosin is critical as it is the rosin that creates the sound while playing. Liebenzeller rosin enhances a string instrument's sound as well as the player's creativity with as little effort as possible. We are proud to reintroduce Liebenzeller rosin to the United States after an extended period when it was unavailable here. Liebenzeller rosin is available with Gold, Silver, Copper or Meteor Iron added for a range of unique sounds. GOLD Uniquely balanced; the sound is full, round and warm as well as bright and crisp, transparent and light in high notes. Grades I (hard) to VI (soft): the softer grades make the harshness of an instrument milder and enhance it, the harder grades provide more clarity. Gold IV: uniquely balanced, a bit more mellow (cello)",

      "description": "LIEBENZELLER rosin LIEBENZELLER metal rosin has been made in a small village in the German black forest for over 40 years. Made traditionally by hand, LIEBENZELLER rosin contains delicate bubbles which emphasize the special quality and spirited nature of the rosin. Using pure larch resin with the addition of different metals produces livelier, warmer and brighter sounds than other rosins. This will help produce enhanced tonal volume, greater modulation and carrying power, conveying the individual sound of the instrument without effort, and one-sided tones can be compensated. The bow develops an excellent and even response, with ambient noise minimized. Choosing the right rosin is critical as it is the rosin that creates the sound while playing. LIEBENZELLER rosin enhances a string instrument's sound as well as the player's creativity with as little effort as possible. We are proud to reintroduce LIEBENZELLER rosin to the united States after an extended period when it was unavailable here. LIEBENZELLER rosin is available with Gold, silver, copper or meteor Iron added for a range of unique sounds. Meteor Iron wonderfully clear, the tone is light, brilliant and sounds vigorous even if played softly. The player's intention can be heard more easily. Especially suitable for solos.

Cosmo black hardware adds a hint of stealth. At the heart of the SR305E’s electronics are two PowerSpan Dual Coil pickups. Their stainless pole pieces offer higher output, clarity, and fullness than any in the SR305’s class. Accessed by the 3-way “Power Tap” switch, these proprietary pickups offer a choice of three tonal personalities: A rich humbucker sound, a pure single-coil sound, or an enhanced single coil sound— fattened by lows from the humbucker pickups.

      "description": "Prolong your tone with the same premium electric guitar strings that experienced players worldwide trust to keep their incredible tone longer than any other string available. Unlike other string brands, Elixir Strings coats the whole string. This protects not only the outer string surface but also the gaps between the windings where common tone-deadening gunk typically builds up in other brands’ coated and uncoated guitar strings. Who wouldn’t love more quality playing time between the hassle and cost of string changes? Crafted to last, these nickel-plated steel electric guitar strings boast a warm, robust tone while the POLYWEB Coating brings a slick, fast feel to the playing experience. For a more traditionally textured, “uncoated” feel and a brighter, punchier tone, try our electric guitar strings with ultra-thin NANOWEB Coating. Of course, the kind of string you play is all a matter of personal preference. Not sure what tone or feel is right for you? Try them out for yourself, and find your new favorite string from Elixir Strings. For a more in-depth look at what makes our strings so special, scroll to the branded info further down the page. Elixir Strings: Great tone. Long life.",

A year after celebrating the 50th anniversary of Walter Hofner's original violin bass, made famous by a certain Beatle who shall remain nameless, they have decided to produce a contemporary version. It has a vintage look that will produce many \"oohs\", and an internal sustain block that creates a more modern, deep-resonating sound that will produce many \"aahs.\" It's the kind of bass guitar people love to see, play, and hear. Aesthetically, this model features a maple-beech-maple set neck with rosewood fretboard accentuated by mother-of-pearl dot inlays, the signature Hofner violin bass headstock, a brass trapeze tailpiece, and glossy spruce top with glossy flamed maple back and sides. An ebony bridge with movable metal saddles maintains intonation and string spacing. The nickel-plated hardware and floating celluloid pearl pickguard give it an extra little pop for the eyes. On the electronics side, you're working with two original Hofner 511B 'Staple' humbucking pickups, as well as a control panel with 2 volume controls, 2 on/off switches, and a rhythm/solo switch for volume boost. The overall sound is warm like the original model, but with a little more sonic kick for a more \"now\" sound. Includes case.",

      "average_rating": 4,
      "features": [
        "【Tourte Style】-- Due to its high sound quality, low price, and remarkable usability, this is the most often used mute for solo and orchestral playing. They are small pieces of rubber that cling to the bridge of the violin and silence some of the light overtones played by the strings on the violin.",
        "【Dampen The Sound】-- Facmogu Violin mutes are devices that attach to the bridge of the instrument to \"mute\" the instrument, or dampen the sound. They do this by limiting the vibration of the bridge, which prevents the instrument from resonating and amplifying the sound produced by the strings.",
        "【Easy to Use】-- Choosing the violin mute that will be the simplest for you to use is important since you need to be able to swiftly put it on and take it off during concerts. This one hole mute from Facmogu is the better choice because it is smaller and simpler to rapidly put on. When not in use the mute can stay on the violin strings near the tailpiece or easily be taken off.",
        "【Premium Rubber】-- Our Facmogu Violin Mute are made of rubber material, which are soft and environmental, comfortable and durable in use. Additionally, it is portable and lightweight, and its soft rubber composition won't scratch or harm the bridge. Great for practicing palying violin when you don't want to disturb others, especially for the late night practicing.",
        "【Readiness Is All】-- Mutes are inexpensive, it's wise to keep a few extra mutes on hand because they're easy to lose due to their small size. 8 PCS violin mute were included in this pack. While practice mutes are not strictly necessary, it’s worth investing in one. You never know where and when you might need to practice without disturbing the people around you."
      ],
      "description": "Features & Benefits Violin mutes are essential for two reasons: they produce more colors in your playing and also decrease the volume output. For a more advanced repertoire, a violinist likely would want to create more vivid colors; a violin mute allows you to do this by dampening the vibrations of your violin, thus changing the natural sound of your instrument. Additionally, it allows you to lower the volume in order vibration to not disturb others as much. If you plan on playing in an orchestra, you will most definitely need a mute. Mutes are small pieces of rubber that cling to the bridge of the violin and silence some of the light overtones played by the strings on the violin. This produces a much more mellow, quieter sound that a lot of orchestras use in various pieces, particularly in romantic and contemporary era music. Definitely a must for someone who plans on being in an orchestra. This is a soft mute, meaning that it softens and mellows the sound of your violin and takes the edge off so you can practice without hurting your ear. It's also good for playing with others so you won't over power them with your loud violin. It's a nice soft rubber and easily goes on and off.",

Embraced by bassists over the decades, the iconic series continues to excite with its smooth, fast neck, lightweight body and perfectly matched electronics. The SR300EB is a handsome 4-string bass designed for the experienced player. The bass starts with an immaculately finished Mahogany body. Other features include a sturdy 5-piece Maple/Rosewood SR4 neck, a Rosewood fretboard, and an Accu-cast B120 bridge for superior string vibration transfer and precise intonation. Black hardware adds a hint of stealth. At the heart of the SR300EB’s electronics are two PowerSpan Dual Coil pickups. Their stainless pole pieces offer higher output, clarity, and fullness than any in the SR300’s class. Accessed by the 3-way “Power Tap” switch, these proprietary pickups offer a choice of three tonal personalities: A rich humbucker sound, a pure single-coil sound, or an enhanced single coil sound—fattened by lows from the humbucker pickups. Add the ability to dial in precise tone preferences via the Ibanez Custom 3-band EQ, and the SR300EB is a musical chameleon.",

Evah Pirazzi Gold cello strings are extremely responsive and react quickly over the entire dynamic range; even with very gentle bow pressure. With their reduced playing-in time, the instrument achieves its full sound spectrum in no time. Each Evah Pirazzi Gold cello string has its own individual character and at the same time their interplay generates a wonderfully harmonious set. Beginning with a smooth and rich spectrum of sound colors, the A-string has a warm and silvery sound that will easily satisfy the expectations of soloists. Charm, brilliance, and lightness are the sound characteristics of the D-string. The seamless transition to the G-string adds a further nuance that can be heard. The sound becomes very grand and develops an impressive radiance, even straight after stringing. Vibrant and resonant the C-string was designed to provide the player with a focused direct sound that will inspire and at the same time bring this set to its powerful completion. The A and D strings have a high-tensile steel core and are wound with a precision chrome steel flat wire, while the G and C strings have a specially designed steel rope core with a top-quality tungsten winding. These strings are also very suitable for electric or electrically-amplified cellos.",

Working with Billy Shredneck developed two new Billy Sheehan Signature Bassneck models. 100% fully authorized by Billy himself! Available in two colors and modeled after his signature style these new Bassnecks will allow you to practice anytime, anywhere, when a full size bass is not convenient. The SHREDNECK (Patent) is the ultimate practice and warm-up tool for guitar players. When it is not convenient to play guitar/bass, or if a guitar/bass is not available, or if you are traveling, on the way to a gig, hanging out or just watching TV, you can still practice and develop your playing skills. The SHREDNECK is designed to play and feel like the first frets of a guitar/bass/acoustic depending on the model. The tuning machines used to adjust the string tension to accommodate different playing styles and situations (they are not used to tune the SHREDNECK). The fret spacing and neck width are modeled after the first frets of a standard electric guitar/bass/acoustic depending on the model. The SHREDNECK will help you develop your playing skills, particularly your fingering and playing speed. Since the SHREDNECK uses real strings and frets, you will also develop calluses needed for playing. The SHREDNECK is also an ideal way to warm-up before playing or performing. You can also use the SHREDNECK to keep warmed-up between sets. The SHREDNECK is not a hand exerciser; it is a practice and warm-up tool. As a player you would want your hands and fingers to be limber and quick. Hand exercisers can build strength which we feel can actually slow you down and make it uncomfortable to play. The SHREDNECK is closest thing to playing bass other than actually playing bass! Note that the Shredneck is not an instrument, so it will not tune, it is purely a practice tool.",

A bound Rosewood fingerboard features black fret lines that balance competing goals for guiding positions and keep the fretboard from disturbing the atmosphere expected in a fretless layout. A contoured neck heel is applied to create a deep neck joint with unfettered access to upper frets. The custom bridge contains the magic of the AeroSilk Piezo system, which works with D'Addario ECB81 flat wound strings to provide that sense of “air” that characterizes the upright sound.",

      "description": "These strings have a highly flexible, multi-strand nylon core and cater for artists who feel uncomfortable with steel strings. The resounding success of our Dominant string owes a lot to its similarity in tone and response to gut strings, without gut's attendant drawbacks. The sound of the Dominant string is full and mellow, yet rich in overtones. Its radiance, its ability to project sound without being metallic, comes to the fore both in arco and pizzicato. Comparable in sound to gut, without gut's disadvantages. Other advantages are Dominant's effortless response to intricate fingering and its tuning stability even under extreme atmospheric conditions. But Dominant's beauty of tone is not as long lasting as that of a steel string, a price the discerning musician will be prepared to pay for this quality of sound. Dominant strings should be changed at appropriate intervals to ensure continuity of tone color. N.B. The playing and tuning peg length of the string are critical, so the string used should be exactly matched to the instrument's measurements",

      "description": "Johannes Brahms: The Works for one Instrument and Piano Johannes Brahms’ compositions for one instrument and piano have been standards in chamber music literature ever since their inception. These works were written with specific performers in mind and Brahms worked closely with them when refining the final texts. Nevertheless, we rarely approach the music taking into consideration the possibilities of the instruments for which Brahms wrote or the performing practices of the individual players who first performed these compositions, including Brahms himself. The New Urtext Editions Bärenreiter’s pioneering new scholarly-critical editions of Brahms’ works for one instrument and piano are edited by a team of musicologists who are also performers. They offer today’s musicians not just a reliable musical text based on all known sources, but also a comprehensive approach to the works, which aims to place them in their historical context and to elucidate the complex of meanings that the composer wished his notation to convey to performers. In addition to the musical text these editions offer an informative Introduction laying out the genesis, publication history and reception of the works. At the same time there is a complete list of the sources, an explanation of the editorial procedures and a Critical Commentary. Also, each volume contains a detailed discussion of specific performing practice issues raised by individual works. An integral part of Bärenreiter’s Brahms publication complex is a text booklet which approaches general performance practice issues of the 19th century with regard to e.g. tempo, rubato, rhythmic flexibility and articulation. Furthermore musicians will find valuable information concerning vibrato, portamento and bowing. Last but not least characteristics of Brahms’ own piano playing as well as that of his circle and contemporaries are discussed.",

It has incredible harmonic content across all frequency ranges, and an insanely tight bass response. The Nazgûl has a seriously aggressive high gain sound that is lively, yet completely controllable. The Sentient neck delivers a balanced, versatile tone that fits right between the '59 model and the Jazz neck pickup. You'll get pristine cleans, and fluid leads under high gain. The Sentient is a very articulate vintage output pickup with great dynamic response and a wide harmonic range. It works great for low tunings in all humbucker-equipped guitars. Hand built in our Santa Barbara, CA factory, the Nazgûl and Sentient both use a large ceramic and alnico 5 bar magnets, nickel silver bottom plate, 4-conductor lead wire for multiple wiring options, and are vacuum wax potted for squeal-free performance.",

      "description": "Fans of the Jazz bass know that jazz bass pickups built by Fender in the 1970’s sound very different from the pickups used in the 60’s. The 70’s versions have a brighter, more strident tone that is perfect for slapping, funk and R&B. They are also perfect for many rock styles. An example of this sound range from the rock styling’s of Geddy Lee to Marcus Miller’s Jazz/Funk inflections. Because pickup windings and materials varied so much throughout the 70’s, we used several pickups from different years as our sonic models. Through a process of listening and prototyping we discovered the very small gradations of wire size and winding patterns that reproduce the bright and deep sound of the 70’s jazz bass pickup. The AG 4J-70 pickups complement any bass and are a great match with Aguilar’s OBP on-board preamps. Available as a calibrated neck and bridge pickup set for four string basses, the AG 4J-70 pickups are direct replacements for Jazz Bass style basses.",

Embraced by bassists over the decades, the iconic series continues to excite with its smooth, fast neck, lightweight body and perfectly matched electronics. The SR300E is a handsome 4-string bass designed for the experienced player. The bass starts with an immaculately finished Mahogany body. Other features include a sturdy 5-piece Maple/Rosewood SR4 neck, a Rosewood fretboard, and an Accu-cast B120 bridge for superior string vibration transfer and precise intonation. Cosmo Black hardware adds a hint of stealth. At the heart of the SR300E’s electronics are two PowerSpan Dual Coil pickups. Their stainless pole pieces offer higher output, clarity, and fullness than any in the SR300’s class. Accessed by the 3-way “Power Tap” switch, these proprietary pickups offer a choice of three tonal personalities: A rich humbucker sound, a pure single-coil sound, or an enhanced single coil sound— fattened by lows from the humbucker pickups. Add the ability to dial in precise tone preferences via the Ibanez Custom 3-band EQ, and the SR300E is a musical chameleon.",

Each individual string in the Pirastro line has been meticulously crafted to provide musicians with an unsurpassed choice in tonal colours.

Thomastik Dominant strings have a highly flexible, multi-strand nylon core that is comparable in sound and feel to natural gut. Comparable in sound to gut, without gut's disadvantage. These strings have a highly flexible, multi-strand nylon core and cater to artists who feel uncomfortable with steel strings. The resounding success of the Dominant string owes a lot to its similarity in tone and response to gut strings, without gut's inherent drawbacks. The sound of the Dominant string is full and mellow, yet rich in overtones. Its radiance, its ability to project sound without being metallic, comes to the fore both in arco and pizzicato. Other advantages are Dominant's effortless response to intricate fingering and its tuning stability even under extreme atmospheric conditions. But Dominant's beauty of tone is not as long-lasting as that of a steel string, a price the discerning musician will be prepared to pay for this quality of sound. Dominant strings should be changed at appropriate intervals to ensure continuity of tone color",

In 1960, Peter Prier immigrated to the United States after graduating from the Violin Making School of Bavaria in Mittenwald, Germany. He was a pioneer in many aspects. He brought master skills to the new world, set up a world-class violin shop, and founded the renowned Violin Making School of America. He also began the creation of a non-wood bow long before its time. While fulfilling his passion as a master luthier and teacher, Peter's wisdom and experience inspired the next generation to create bows of uncompromising quality in the tradition of the fine French masters. All JonPaul bows share a one piece molding process. Single-piece construction means the stick is strong from tip to button. You can feel secure playing your JonPaul bow indoors, outdoors or in a cramped orchestra pit. The proof is in the playing!

Having the actual note to look at helps if you want to learn to read standard music notation and helps you with timing for playing the song. For songs that have multiple verses you repeat at the start. Some songs may have specific playing instructions. Sheet of words to the songs included where applicable. The song cards measure 4 1/2 inches at the top, 12 inches at the bottom, and 7 5/8 inches from top to bottom.",

      "description": "EMG along with legendary artist Geezer Butler have collaborated to develop the GZR-P and GZR-PJ signature bass pickup sets. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame bass player started working with EMG founder Rob Turner in 2011, looking to recreate the classic bass tones he had in Black Sabbath’s early days. As Geezer and Black Sabbath moved from studio to touring in 2013 the final component of getting the classic Geezer tone was in play - a passive pickup with a truly vintage tone an feel. To recapture Geezer’s early Black Sabbath tone, it meant a new EMG vintage style passive P & PJ design with a few modern touches. The all solderless P set uses Alnico V pole pieces and custom wound coils for just the right amount of punch and grit. The J (PJ set) also uses Alnico 5 poles and features two custom wound split-coils. This eliminates the noise and hum usually associated with early 70’s bass pickups and allows for more power and volume than any other standard single coil J - creating a remarkable balance between the P and the J. The result is an unmistakable early Geezer Butler bass tone with deep, tight low end that you hear on tunes like “Iron Man,” “War Pigs,” and “Paranoid,” just like 1970’s. “I never felt comfortable giving my name to any other pickups, but this time these have blown me away.” - Geezer Butler",

The perfect choice for metal players looking for warm complex chording and singing leads, the original Blackouts neck practically cries out for two-handed shred and thick rhythm playing. Its extended frequency response and organic feel make this a great humbucker for those who demand both responsiveness and the true tonal character of their guitar to shine through. The original Blackouts bridge humbucker delivers all of the power and full bodied punch that todays metal players demand from an active pickup. You get the high output signal level of an active pickup, with more of an organic feel and open tonal response that allows the character of your guitar to come through. The treble and bass response is extended beyond the range of traditional active pickups, and has been carefully balanced with a slightly scooped midrange for the perfect crunch. This pickup excels at screaming pinched harmonics and hyper-speed riffage with responsive dynamics across the entire fretboard. Comes with pots, hardware, quick-connector cables, capacitor (active pickups require a special cap value), output jack, battery clip, and wire needed for installation. If your guitar already has active pickups with quick-connector cables installed, you should be able to simply unplug them and plug in your Blackouts.",

At the heart of every NS bowed electric instrument is the Polar pickup system. Sensor and bridge geometry are integrated to translate every nuance to the amplifier and speaker system. The Polar pickup has the unique ability to analyze the direction of string vibration to enhance the bowed response and to facilitate bow technique. The unusually powerful piezo crystals do not require on-board power, for maintenance-free performance without the hassle of batteries. The reserve power of a well set up electric violin makes the instrument easier to play than a conventional acoustic. The WAV violins' rock maple bridge is easily adjustable for the playing style and action height you prefer, high and powerful like a traditional violin, low and fast like an electric guitar, or anywhere in between. The ebony fingerboard is graduated for each string to optimize the tone and playability of every note. The neck is smooth and fast, with traditional thumb reference points for the scroll and heel. The removable bout provides accurate position reference for players accustomed to using the traditional body shape for reference. Light weight and good balance are the essential comfort factors for any violin. The fully carved interior of the WAV Violin keeps the weight to the minimum, and the body mounted tuners bring the center of gravity back over the shoulder where it belongs. The shoulder rest is contoured and padded to provide stable support, and is fully adjustable to accommodate differences in playing styles and body types.

Made traditionally by hand, LIEBENZELLER rosin contains delicate bubbles which emphasize the special quality and spirited nature of the rosin. Using pure larch resin with the addition of different metals produces livelier, warmer and brighter sounds than other rosins. This will help produce enhanced tonal volume, greater modulation and carrying power, conveying the individual sound of the instrument without effort, and one-sided tones can be compensated. The bow develops an excellent and even response, with ambient noise minimized. Choosing the right rosin is critical as it is the rosin that creates the sound while playing. LIEBENZELLER rosin enhances a string instrument's sound as well as the player's creativity with as little effort as possible. We are proud to reintroduce LIEBENZELLER rosin to the united States after an extended period when it was unavailable here. LIEBENZELLER rosin is available with Gold, silver, copper or meteor Iron added for a range of unique sounds. Silver generates a mellow warm sound, especially in the high notes. Makes fine nuances possible, and the bow glides flexibility even in pianissimo. Silver II: mellow and warm, a bit softer (violin, viola)",

The neck is solid sheesham rosewood and features a nut width of 37mm (1.5 inches) with a bone nut. This instrument is outfitted with standard friction ukulele tuners. The bridge, also made of sheesham rosewood incorporates a genuine bone saddle. An end-pin strap button is standard. Overall size: 26.75 x 9 x 4.75 inches. Shades of colors may vary slightly. These are each individually hand made and will be unique.  The Baroq-uleles come in 3 sizes including Soprano, Concert and Tenor. Each size is graced with its own unique rosette design, each of which is taken from museum examples from the 16th and 17th centuries. In addition to the three sizes, the Baroque-ulele is also available with 3 types of woods for the back: sheesham rosewood, lacewood (chenar) or variegated with alternating staves of rosewood and lacewood. Finally, ensuring that you will find an instrument that best fits your needs, these instruments are also available with two types of tuning keys: Baroque-style ebony tuning pegs or standard ukulele friction tuners.

The HelloCello comes with a real extendable endpin and allows the buyer to choose whether they would like it installed or not. Teachers often find that children develop better posture when the foam cello is suspended between the knees without the endpin installed. A wooden dowel bow is also included to develop bow hold technique and practice bowing movements along the channel in the bridge. There is a convenient cutout on the back of the cello for easy storage of the bow. The cello has attractive painted artwork simulating the strings, scroll, pegs, f-holes, and tailpiece.

      "description": "The new Schatten CH-1 is designed for use on smaller bodied Celtic harps having 28 strings or less. It provides a very simple solution to the problem of quickly and easily adding a pickup to a harp. The pickup sensor simply sticks to the soundboard next to the string strip, while the output jack assembly has a clip on its' back that allows it to easily clip to the edge of any sound port of the back of the harp. Up to 18 inches of the lead wire from the pickup sensor to the output jack stores right inside the jack assembly box - which keeps everything neat and tidy. The CH-1 can easily be moved from one harp to another - so one pickup can be used on more than one harp. The CH-1 is a passive pickup. It will work properly going straight into most normal electric guitar or bass amplifiers. If you are going to go directly into a P.A. system or mixer board, a preamp such as the Schatten Mini Pre acoustic preamp will be needed. Adding the Mini-Pre preamp will allow you to use this pickup to its full potential no matter what you are plugging into - any type of amp or any PA system.",

These new steel strings provide a variety of overtones with great projection, without any metallic sharpness. Evah Pirazzi Gold cello strings are extremely responsive and react quickly over the entire dynamic range; even with very gentle bow pressure. With their reduced playing-in time, the instrument achieves its full sound spectrum in no time. Each Evah Pirazzi Gold cello string has its own individual character and at the same time their interplay generates a wonderfully harmonious set. Beginning with a smooth and rich spectrum of sound colors, the A-string has a warm and silvery sound that will easily satisfy the expectations of soloists. Charm, brilliance, and lightness are the sound characteristics of the D-string. The seamless transition to the G-string adds a further nuance that can be heard. The sound becomes very grand and develops an impressive radiance, even straight after stringing. Vibrant and resonant the C-string was designed to provide the player with a focused direct sound that will inspire and at the same time bring this set to its powerful completion. The A and D strings have a high-tensile steel core and are wound with a precision chrome steel flat wire, while the G and C strings have a specially designed steel rope core with a top-quality tungsten winding. These strings are also very suitable for electric or electrically-amplified cellos.",

You've spent hours and hours researching, eventually purchasing a guitar that looks and feels right to you. Perfect weight, neck shape, body style, neck profile, and electronics. But what does all that time spent mean if you don't have the right strings? That combo of tonewoods and your preamp's special bells and whistles just won't reach their full potential. While you may enjoy your sound at first, you're really cheating your fingers and ears in the long run. And let's face it, most guitars come with average strings that just give it just enough to entice. They aren't meant to be long-term sound solutions. That's where D'Addario NYXL strings come in. D'Addario NYXL guitar strings will bend farther, sing louder, and stay in tune better than almost any other strings. Envisioned, perfected, and manufactured by D'Addario in New York, this newly engineered, break-resistant high-carbon steel core and plain steel alloy delivers a whole new level of freedom, confidence, and power. NYXL's provide more strength and 131% more tuning stability by utilizing a completely reinvented wire drawing process and revolutionary corrosion-resistant tin coating application. The reformulated nickel-plated string windings have greater magnetic properties resulting in higher output and enhanced mid-range frequency response for more presence and crunch. The NYXL1046 set is designed with the most popular string gauges for its ideal combination of flexibility and tone.",

This tuning and setup makes it easy for NON-bassists and NON-guitarists to get started playing bass along with their favorite cigar box guitar songs... we even include a how-to-play section in the assembly guide walking you through playing along with your first couple of songs!We named this the \"G-Bass\" kit for three reasons: it's a play on the classic \"P-Bass\" released by Fender in the 1950's; it's tuned to Open G; and it's designed and made by Gitty!Featuring a solid hard maple neck and box-through brace, and a genuine mahogany fretboard/fingerboard. The box is cut from 1/4\" and 1/8\" Arctic Birch plywood, which has superior tonal qualities. We include two chrome bass guitar tuners, a hardwood bridge, and a custom stainless steel tailpiece of (cut here in the C. B. Gitty workshop). The fully pre-wired pickup harness features a classic-style black covered bass pickup, volume pot and standard mono jack. Includes decorative nickel-plated box corners and chrome strap buttons.The kit includes a fully fretted fretboard using the shorter 30-inch scale made popular by Fender's \"Mustang\" model back in the 60's. The shorter scale makes it easier to play a 2-string bass, since you don't have to move around quite as much. Overall assembled length of the instrument is 40 inches.This kit includes a full assembly guide packed with photos and detailed how-to information. You will need basic tools (drill, drill bits, clamps, sandpaper, files/rasps, etc) to assemble this kit. The body of the instrument is a laser-cut plywood box specially designed by Ben \"Gitty\" Baker for strength and sturdiness; this box comes in its natural \"blank slate\" wood state, so that you can stain, decorate and apply finishes as desired.",

      "description": "Liebenzeller Rosin Liebenzeller metal rosin has been made in a small village in the German Black Forest for over 40 years. Made traditionally by hand, Liebenzeller rosin contains delicate bubbles which emphasize the special quality and spirited nature of the rosin. Using pure larch resin with the addition of different metals produces livelier, warmer and brighter sounds than other rosins. This will help produce enhanced tonal volume, greater modulation and carrying power, conveying the individual sound of the instrument without effort, and one-sided tones can be compensated. The bow develops an excellent and even response, with ambient noise minimized. Choosing the right rosin is critical as it is the rosin that creates the sound while playing. Liebenzeller rosin enhances a string instrument's sound as well as the player's creativity with as little effort as possible. We are proud to reintroduce Liebenzeller rosin to the United States after an extended period when it was unavailable here. Liebenzeller rosin is available with Gold, Silver, Copper or Meteor Iron added for a range of unique sounds. GOLD Uniquely balanced; the sound is full, round and warm as well as bright and crisp, transparent and light in high notes. Grades I (hard) to VI (soft): the softer grades make the harshness of an instrument milder and enhance it, the harder grades provide more clarity. Gold II: uniquely balanced, a bit more mellow (violin, viola)",

The Tricolore brand, used by many famous violin soloists, was one of the most well known violin strings made in the 20th century. Now, after many decades of being unavailable, we are pleased to offer these strings again. This string was developed by Ray Neiner at the Perfection Musical String Co. Brunswick, IN, just south of Chicago. The machines we use at Gamut Music to make the strings were purchased from the Perfection company and in addition to the machines we also received the formulations that Perfection used to make their strings, including the Tricolore brand. We have in our archives a copy of the Perfection workshop book that specifies the gauge of gut used for the cores, the size of the wires, length of the strings, and colors of the thread used for the stockings at the top and bottom of the strings. In addition to this practical information, we also received instruction for the special curing treatment that the gut cores went through before being wound and the specific techniques used in winding the wire onto the gut core. These strings are accurate copies of the ones that filled American concert halls with sound in the 20th century.",

A low profile, light-weight design reduces player fatigue while allowing clear line of sight to the fingerboard.

Compared to metal practice mutes, the Catrpilr cannot fall off or scrape the bridge and the profile is low enough that the mute can safely be left on even when the instrument is in a case. Model v1.1.2020. Patent Pending. Made in USA. Please visit the manufacturer website for detailed mounting instructions. Do not attempt to mount the catrpilr like other traditional push-on mutes. The catrpilr is designed to be mounted using one hand while the instrument is held between the chin and shoulder. First attach the middle foot to the bridge and then work your way outwards. The outside feet have a small catch on the back that is designed to be used to hook the outer feet around the bridge.",

Depending on the metal addition, each rosin is able to produce a wide differentiation in sound quality. To take full advantage of the high quality rosin please keep in mind the following: Before applying the metal rosin for the first time, the bow should be thoroughly cleaned. Apply less rosin to the bow then you normally would and clean the strings with alcohol from time to time. The bow should also be cleaned with alcohol, but less frequently. Often in the beginning, too much rosin is applied to the bow and therefore it does not stick very well to the strings. When this happens, the tone may not develop fully. Rosin with Gold LARICA Metal Rosin with Gold is now available in hardness' from I to IV. LARICA Metal rosin with Gold addition has uniquely balanced characteristics: the sound is full, round and warm as well as bright and crisp. This rosin gives the best variety of tone qualities to the instrument.",

According to Egyptian ancient maps, this instrument appeared in the third or fourth millennium BC. At that time, it was shaped like a bow with strings. Legend has it that it was invented inspired by the chirping of the arrows when shooting arrows. In the middle Ages, it was recorded that the ancient harp was the lyre, and after many years of successive improvements, the modern harp was formed. It is exquisite and beautiful in shape, silver crystal clear pure like jade beads. The ancient Egyptians regarded the harp as a sacred instrument. The harp gained considerable popularity about a thousand years ago. Because of its rich connotation and charming sound quality, the harp has become a special color instrument in the symphony orchestra and musical dramas. It mainly plays the harmonic accompaniment and the decorative sentences in the sliding style. It often plays the finishing touch and makes the audience unforgettable. The harp is also an important solo instrument in chamber music. Solo can play a soft and beautiful lyric section or cadenza, very infectious.

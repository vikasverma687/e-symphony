# E-Symphony

**E-Symphony** is a static e-commerce website that displays a product catalog. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to browse products, filter by category, search by title, and manage a shopping cart. The site is served using a simple Node.js server.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the server on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vikasverma687/e-symphony.git
```

### 2. Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To verify that Node.js is installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```


### 3. Start the Server
To start the server, run the following command in your project folder:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start a server on `localhost` at port `3000` by default.

### 4. Open the Application
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the server on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven’t already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vikasverma687/e-symphony.git
```

### 2. Install Node.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To verify that Node.js is installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```


### 3. Start the Server
